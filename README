A simple tool to help deciding where to build a new city in the game FreeCiv.

This tool is an experiment I made while playing a FreeCiv marathon. One can recreate the map as it is in FreeCiv, including roads and special resources and such. You can also simulate certain buildings, like a harbour, and set the government to see the effects on the resources of the tiles.

The code is definitely not industry-strength! (It always surprises me how much more work coding properly really is..) I've put it on Github just in case it might serve to help or inspire someone else.
